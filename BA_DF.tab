The STT was competitively selected as providing the best value to Boeing and its U.S. Government customer based upon its capability, product maturity and proven reliability as the only small form factor Link 16 and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) capable aviation terminal fielded in the world.  The STT will enable the USMC's Harriers to better coordinate their activities with other U.S. and allied aircraft as well as with U.S. and allied ground forces using both Link 16 and SRW networks in order to more rapidly engage enemy targets and to do so with reduced risk of fratricide or collateral damage."

The decision by American to push back some of its Boeing Co  and Airbus orders comes two weeks after Delta  Air Lines Inc said it was reviewing wide-body jet orders  to address excess capacity, noting that reductions were likely  over the next several years.  While demand for smaller and more standardised narrowbody  aircraft has proved resilient to economic weakness as leasing  companies move them to where they are most needed, the market  for the more customised widebody jets is more easily saturated  as manufacturers bring out competing models simultaneously."

The appeal comes seven years after Airbus won what at the time was regarded as a definitive 3.5 billion euro bailout for the delayed project, plagued from the start by political wrangling over the choice of new European engines. Airbus said recent problems with engine gearboxes and delays in supplying defensive aids had led to severe penalties, bureaucratic arguments and cash being held back by governments."

The deal took weeks of shuttling between Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, and Tehran, complicated by a shortage of expert legal advice as Iran completes its biggest commercial deals with the West since its 1979 Islamic revolution.

The deal between IranAir and U.S. planemaker Boeing includes 50 narrow-body 737 MAX aircraft and 30 long-haul 777s, split equally between the 777-300ER, which is badly in need of an order boost, and the 406-seat 777-9, which is under development. An Iranian official told Reuters that IranAir was also at the very final stage of formalizing a deal with Europe's Airbus, which led Western companies back into Iran with a provisional agreement for 118 planes when Tehran emerged from global sanctions in January."

It was the latest example of Trump using his podium, often via brief Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages."

The move in the waning months of Democratic President Barack Obama's administration to further unlock jetliner sales to Iran prompted complaints from Republicans in Congress and is likely to raise the ire of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has said he would dismantle the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, which includes a measure allowing U.S. and European companies to sell Iran civilian aircraft."

While it is not part of the dispute over claims in the South China Sea, Indonesia objects to China's claim to waters around the Natuna Islands and has been ramping up military exercises and patrols in the region. Indonesia, which faced a U.S. arms embargo until just over a decade ago, has yet to nail down a winner for the highest profile item on its wish list - a squadron of jets to replace its ageing Northrop F-5 fighters, as talks continue with Russia to buy Sukhoi Su-35 jets."
