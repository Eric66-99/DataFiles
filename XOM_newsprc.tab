"Vitol says Exxon Mobil lacked 'transparency' during Torrance outage"	"[Reuters] - Swiss commodity trader Vitol SA criticized Exxon Mobil Corp this week for failing to be transparent about maintenance at its Los Angeles refinery following a February 2015 blast, which contributed to tighter gasoline supplies and higher prices. Speaking before a committee of the California Energy Commission on Tuesday, Brad Lucas, a West Coast trader for Vitol, said that lack of information from Exxon made it difficult to time cargo deliveries into the West Coast market. The explosion at Exxon Mobil's 149,500 barrel-per-day Torrance refinery, which provides about 10 percent of California's gasoline supply, knocked a gasoline-producing unit offline for more than a year."

Reverse osmosis, which has been widely used for decades in desalination plants that turn seawater into drinking water, has long been seen as having applications for the oil and chemicals industry. Now researchers have finally come up with a specially treated polymer that can serve as the semipermeable membrane needed to do reverse osmosis for chemicals manufacturing at room temperature."

The explosion at Exxon Mobil's 149,500 barrel-per-day Torrance refinery, which provides about 10 percent of California's gasoline supply, knocked a gasoline-producing unit offline for more than a year."

"Saudi Naimi's battles against Western greed shine light on Aramco IPO"	"[Reuters - UK Focus] - As Saudi Arabia prepares for the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO), memoirs from its former oil minister Ali al-Naimi offer a rare insight into decades of domestic infighting over the future of state-run Saudi Aramco. The 300-page book, titled Out of the Desert and published by Portfolio Penguin, describes the battles waged by the influential industry veteran including fending off Western attempts to gain control of oil giant Aramco's best assets. Naimi joined Aramco as a teenager in 1947 and climbed through the ranks to become company chief from 1983 to 1995, when he was named minister of petroleum - a post he retained until his retirement this year."

Kashagan had produced more than 600,000 tonnes (4.7 million barrels) since test pumping started there on Sept. 28, of which more than 500,000 tonnes had been exported, he said. Kazakhstan's output has been falling for the last three years, but Kashagan's launch is set to reverse the trend and the Central Asian country has previously said it did not want to cut production further."

For now, based on our view of a high-$40s/low-$50s [per barrel] oil-price environment through 2020 and our forecasts for cash margins for Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM), we believe both companies will be reliant on asset sales to <U+393C><U+3E33>pay the bills.<U+393C><U+3E34> Thus dividend growth likely will remain minimal and share repurchases rare through 2018 at least."

"Russia's Rosneft clinches gas pipeline deal with Iraq's Kurdistan"	"Russian oil major Rosneft  will invest in gas pipelines in Iraq's autonomous  Kurdistan, expanding its commitment to the region ahead of an  independence referendum to help it become a major exporter of  gas to Turkey and Europe.  Kurdistan's parliament approved a plan on Friday to hold a  referendum on independence on Sept. 25, ignoring opposition from  Baghdad and the wider region as well as Western concerns that  the vote could heighten tensions in the region.  Kurdistan has been exporting oil independently from Baghdad  since 2014 and Kremlin-controlled Rosneft joined the list of  buyers this year, lending the region hundreds of millions of  dollars in loans guaranteed by future oil sales."

"Mexico warns U.S. against 'protectionist war,' peso weakens"	"Mexican officials warned on  Thursday that U.S. proposals in ongoing NAFTA negotiations would  result in protectionism and higher prices rather than free  trade, as concerns about the future of the deal helped drag the  peso to four-month lows.  Negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the United States are  due to begin a fourth round of talks to renegotiate the North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in Washington next week.  Senators from President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI) said they would oppose any deal that  included proposals such as setting a national quota for  U.S.-made auto parts and increasing controls over the trade in  fresh produce, people close to the talks said."

As a result, companies such as Chevron (CVX.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), France' Total (TOTF.PA) and China's largest refiner Sinopec could see profits from refining drop by 70 percent or more over the period, according to the report co-authored by environment thinktank Carbon Tracker, Swedish investment fund AP7 and Danish pension fund PKA."

Russia, which this year reduced production significantly with OPEC for the first time, has been pushing for a clear message on how to exit the cuts so the market doesn't flip into a deficit too soon, prices don't rally too fast and rival U.S.  Russia needs much lower oil prices to balance its budget than OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia, which is preparing a stock market listing for national energy champion Aramco next year and would hence benefit from pricier crude."
