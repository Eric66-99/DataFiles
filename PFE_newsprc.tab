The mechanism, which so far has British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline signed up to provide its pneumonia vaccine at the lowest possible price, will ask other major pharmaceutical firms including Pfizer and Merck to make similar cut-price agreements for emergencies only. The idea is that this will set a model in place for other manufacturers to put their vaccines on the table, said Greg Elder, a medical coordinator with the international charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) which joined talks on the issue at the WHO's Geneva headquarters last week."

The spiralling cost of cancer medicines is a growing concern for doctors and their patients, many of whom struggle to pay for new medicines that often cost $10,000 a month.

At the moment, Pfizer has a joint venture with Merck (MRK) to develop Bavencio, a PD-L1 antibody, but Butler wonders if it might be willing to step back if the data isn’t supportive, and if it might be willing to acquire a company with a different, PD-1 antibody—again if the data bears it out."
