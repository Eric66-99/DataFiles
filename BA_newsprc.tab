Trump has said he would dismantle the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, which includes a measure allowing U.S. and European companies to sell Iran civilian aircraft."

"Iran seals $17 billion Boeing deal, close to Airbus order"	"[Reuters] - PARIS/DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran signed a $16.6 billion deal for 80 Boeing (BA.N) passenger jets on Sunday and was said to be close to another for dozens of Airbus (AIR.PA) planes to complete what would be the biggest package of firm contracts with Western companies since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. The deal between IranAir and U.S. planemaker Boeing includes 50 narrow-body 737 MAX aircraft and 30 long-haul 777s, split equally between the 777-300ER, which is badly in need of an order boost, and the 406-seat 777-9, which is under development. An Iranian official told Reuters that IranAir was also at the very final stage of formalizing a deal with Europe's Airbus, which led Western companies back into Iran with a provisional agreement for 118 planes when Tehran emerged from global sanctions in January."

Bombardier and Embraer have battled for decades over the regional jet market and traded accusations of unfair subsidies in the late 1990s that their countries hashed out at the WTO."

"Airbus seals deal with Iran for sale of 100 aircraft"	"[Reuters - UK Focus] - PARIS, Dec (Shanghai: 600875.SS - news) 22 (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus signed a firm contract on Thursday to sell 100 jets to IranAir, completing a return by Western plane giants and paving the way for deliveries to start next month, a year after sanctions against Iran were lifted. The deal took weeks of shuttling between Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, and Tehran, complicated by a shortage of expert legal advice as Iran completes its biggest commercial deals with the West since its 1979 Islamic revolution. Confirming details first reported by Reuters, Airbus said almost half the jets would be for short to medium routes and that deliveries would start early next year."

The United States' and Mexico's leaders speak by phone after relations between the two countries frayed further over Trump's border wall plan, with the U.S. president calling the talk friendly but still demanding reworked trade and other ties. Nikki Haley, the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, pledges to overhaul the world body and warns U.S. allies that if they do not support Washington, then she is taking names and will respond."

Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, said Lockheed Martin had been responsive to his concerns about the high cost of the stealthy, high-tech warplane. We cut approximately $600 million off the F-35 fighter, and that only amounts to 90 planes out of close to 3,000 planes, Trump said, attributing that figure to Lockheed chief executive Marillyn Hewson."

People involved in the airline deals say it is too early to assess the impact of the US visa ban but worry that hardening rhetoric in Tehran and Washington can only add to a list of complications that could slow, if not endanger, the jet sales."

The plane, produced by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), was originally scheduled to make its debut journey in 2015, but the date was repeatedly pushed back as it underwent additional testing and certification. For China, the aircraft represents at least eight years of effort in a state-mandated drive to reduce the country's reliance on European plane maker Airbus and Boeing of the United States and compete directly against them for market share."

The great boom is over, Richard Aboulafia, analyst at Teal Group, said at an industry conference near Seattle on Wednesday. Multi-year backlogs of jetliner orders at both big plane makers will cushion the downturn, along with rising sales of military aircraft, especially spy and fighter planes as defense spending is expected to rise at least initially under U.S. President Donald Trump, he added."

Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the F-35 program for the Pentagon, gave his new estimate for the future cost of the jet while speaking to the U.S House of Representatives at a Capitol Hill hearing on Thursday. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized the Pentagon's most expensive program for delays and cost overruns, but the price per jet has steadily declined in recent years as production ramps up."

"Bombardier rejects Boeing trade claim, shares slide"	"MONTREAL/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Canada's Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) hit back on Friday at rival U.S. planemaker Boeing Co's (BA.N) claim that it sold jets well below cost to win market share in the United States, the latest sign of increasing trade tensions between the two countries.  The risk of the United States imposing a tariff, which would likely depress sales of Bombardier's newest jet, and concern over how big that tariff might be, unsettled investors, sending the Canadian company's shares down just over 4 percent.  Boeing wants the U.S. government to investigate what it describes as rock-bottom prices for Bombardier's new CSeries aircraft, including an absurdly low sum of $19.6 million it says Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) paid for a jet costing $33 million to build."

Other Canadian funds like Canada Pension Plan Investment  Board (CPPIB), and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan (OTPP), which  joined Caisse in withholding their votes for Beaudoin's  re-election at Bombardier's annual meeting in Montreal on  Thursday, declined to comment."

The French engine maker is scrambling to transport dozens of engine turbines back from the United States, only days before Boeing had been due to start deliveries of the new 737 MAX.  Boeing said on Wednesday that it was suspending 737 MAX test flights while CFM International, an engine venture co-owned by Safran and General Electric (GE.N), conducted checks after a quality problem was found in a turbine disc."

The regulatory hurdle could push back the resumption of 737 MAX flights, a potentially serious issue for Boeing if it delays the scheduled first deliveries of the $110 million plane to airlines this month.  The delivery of a plane is a crucial step for Boeing since it receives the bulk of its payment when it turns over the aircraft keys and airlines fly their new planes home from the factory."

"Exclusive: Canada sought to resolve Boeing military, trade disputes at meeting - sources"	"OTTAWA/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada last month attempted to end a deepening dispute with Boeing Co (BA.N) by suggesting it could withdraw a threat not to buy Super Hornet jets if the U.S. firm dropped a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  The informal proposal would have created an unusual link between trade and arms deals, which are typically separated in international negotiations, trade analysts said, and showed the lengths Canada is willing to go to protect Bombardier jobs.  Ottawa froze talks on a planned purchase of 18 F-18 Super Hornet jets for more than $5 billion after Boeing in April launched a trade challenge accusing Bombardier of dumping its new CSeries airliners into the U.S. market."

Boeing's newer 787-8 Dreamliner (the smallest in the Dreamliner family) offers better range and fuel efficiency than the jet maker's older 767-300 extended range jet, which has not been made for years.
