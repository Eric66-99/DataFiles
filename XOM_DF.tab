As we have detailed in prior reports, we believe that Super Majors must demonstrate the ability to generate enough cash flow from operations to fully fund capital expectations, sustainably grow the dividend and possibly underpin meaningful share repurchases for us to endorse a positive rating for the sector/companies.  For now, based on our view of a high-$40s/low-$50s [per barrel] oil-price environment through 2020 and our forecasts for cash margins for Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM), we believe both companies will be reliant on asset sales to “pay the bills.” Thus dividend growth likely will remain minimal and share repurchases rare through 2018 at least."

Speaking before a committee of the California Energy Commission on Tuesday, Brad Lucas, a West Coast trader for Vitol, said that lack of information from Exxon made it difficult to time cargo deliveries into the West Coast market. The explosion at Exxon Mobil's 149,500 barrel-per-day Torrance refinery, which provides about 10 percent of California's gasoline supply, knocked a gasoline-producing unit offline for more than a year."

Reverse osmosis, which has been widely used for decades in desalination plants that turn seawater into drinking water, has long been seen as having applications for the oil and chemicals industry. Now researchers have finally come up with a specially treated polymer that can serve as the semipermeable membrane needed to do reverse osmosis for chemicals manufacturing at room temperature."
